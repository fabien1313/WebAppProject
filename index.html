  <h3>It is Saturday morning and you are pulled from a sound dream by horrific screaming. As you are gaining your composure you can hear your neighbor pounding and screaming to please let her in. As you slowly approach the door you look through the peephole before answering only to see your neighbor hurt and covered in what looks to be blood. Before you can reach for the door knob you see three figures running with unlimited stamina and growling savagely. Frozen and unable to react you witness the cruel pounding and what looks to be a feast on your welcome matt as your neighbor loses her voice and becomes silent. You are the only one in the house. What do you do next?</h3>

  <h2>First order of business</h2>
  <label for="first"><input type="radio" name="frozen" value="20" id="first" />Call the police and get help.</label>
  <br/>
  <label for="savage"><input type="radio" name="frozen" value="0" id="savage" />Confront the three savage figures head on and then call the police.</label>
  

  <h2>Cell service and the internet are down. The chaos outside is getting worse. You turn on the news and discover that a state of emergency has been declared. “Stay inside, keep away from infected, wait for help to arrive!” You turn around and see one of the zombies looking at you through the living room window. The zombie slams against the glass and ravages its way in.</h2>
  <label for="cell"><input type="radio" name="outside" value="20" id="cell"/>Run to the hallway and grab the bat in the closet.</label>
  <br/>
  <label for="service"><input type="radio" name="outside" value="0" id="service"/>Fight the zombie head on with your fists, there’s only one.</label>
  
 

  <h2>With the chaos worsening and the day becoming dimmer you realize that you have been injured by the zombie from earlier. You have a scratch on your hand, and it starts to become tender.</h2>
  <label for="chaos"><input type="radio" name="scratch" value="20" id="chaos" />Do you remove your hand to stop the spread of the virus?</label>
  <br/>
  <label for="injured"><input type="radio" name="scratch" value="0" id="injured" />Bandage it up, it’s not a bite I’m not worried.</label>


  <h2>Now that you have chosen a way to proceed with your injury you must advise some kind of strategy to survive. You use the emergency radio to get help. The frequency goes berserk and becomes very loud. You rush to turn it off, but you hear growling footsteps approaching nearby. Banging on the front door begins.</h2>
  <label for="survive"><input type="radio" name="emergency" value="20" id="survive" />Stay quite and hide. Surely they will lose interest.</label>
  <br/>
  <label for="strategy"><input type="radio" name="emergency" value="0" id="strategy" />Fight, and take out as many as you can before they attract more.</label>


  <h2>You manage to survive the night. You notice that ever since your injury occurred you have not been feeling well. You are very tired, malnourished and have a growing headache. You can hear rustling in your neighbor’s home. You hear your neighbor’s daughter scream. You know that she is in elementary and has no means to protect herself. You think you might be infected already so do you risk your life to save hers or are you just fatigued from being alert day and night and do nothing choosing to survive.</h2>
  <label for="night"><input type="radio" name="qone" value="0" id="night" />You think you might already be infected so you choose to risk your life saving the little girl.</label>
  <br/>
  <label for="infected"><input type="radio" name="qone" value="20" id="infected" />I’m going through a lot. I’m just tired, drained, and hungry. Survival of the fittest instincts tell me to stay put.</label>
